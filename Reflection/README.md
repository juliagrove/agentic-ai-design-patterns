### **Reflection Pattern:** After an agent creates an initial response, it assesses the output as a second step to improve the quality or correctness of the response

### **Flow**: 
- Creates an initial response normally
- "Critique Mode" on -> AI says "Did I correctly answer the question or task at hand?"
- Generates feedback on the initial response
- Revises based on the feedback
- Loop until answer is "good enough"
